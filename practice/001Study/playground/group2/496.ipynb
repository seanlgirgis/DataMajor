    "## 496: Next Greater Element I\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Description\n",
    "> The next greater element of some element `x` in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of `x` in the same array.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> For each `0 <= i < nums1.length`, find the index `j` such that `nums1[i] == nums2[j]` and determine the next greater element of `nums2[j]` in `nums2`. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is `-1`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Return an array `ans` of length `nums1.length` such that `ans[i]` is the next greater element as described above."

    "### Solution Idea (Pseudo-solution)\n",
    "* **Approach:** Monotonic Stack + Hash Map\n",
    "* **Logic:**\n",
    "    1. We want to find the next greater element for every element in `nums2` efficiently, and then instantly look up the answers for elements in `nums1`.\n",
    "    2. Initialize a hash map `next_greater` to store answers: `{element: next_greater_element}`.\n",
    "    3. Initialize an empty `stack` (monotonic decreasing).\n",
    "    4. Iterate through each `num` in `nums2`:\n",
    "    5.   While the `stack` is not empty and the current `num` is strictly greater than the element at the top of the `stack` (`stack[-1]`):\n",
    "    6.     The current `num` is the \"next greater element\" for the top element.\n",
    "    7.     Pop the top element off the `stack` and add it to the hash map: `next_greater[popped_element] = num`.\n",
    "    8.   Push the current `num` onto the `stack`.\n",
    "    9. After iterating through all of `nums2`, any elements left in the `stack` do not have a next greater element. We can iterate through them and map them to `-1`, or just use `-1` as the default value when looking up the hash map.\n",
    "    10. Finally, construct the answer array by iterating through `nums1` and looking up their next greater element in the `next_greater` map (defaulting to `-1`).\n"
