Give me the next LeetCode problem to drill for my CodeSignal interview prep.

Priority order for topics still to cover:
1. Sliding Window
2. Binary Search
3. Trees (BFS / DFS)
4. Two Pointers
5. Dynamic Programming (basic)
6. Graph traversal

Steps:
1. Check C:/DataMajor/practice/ for existing files to determine which problems are already done and what the next sequence number is (000007, 000008, etc.)
2. Pick the next problem from the priority list above — choose a classic, high-frequency LeetCode problem for that topic
3. State: problem number, title, topic/pattern, and difficulty
4. Give a 1-line problem description
5. Then STOP and wait for the user to attempt a solution before coaching

Do not show hints, approach, or solution yet — just the problem statement.
