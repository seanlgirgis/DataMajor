Save the current problem solution to a clean annotated .py file.

Steps:
1. Determine the next sequence number by checking existing files in C:/DataMajor/practice/
2. Identify the LeetCode problem number from the current conversation
3. Create file: C:/DataMajor/practice/NNNNNN.LCXXXX.py

File must include:
- Header comment block: problem number, title, pattern name, time complexity, space complexity
- Problem statement as a comment (2-3 lines)
- Key insight comment
- Clean solution with inline comments explaining each non-obvious step
- Example test cases at the bottom (at least 2, including an edge case)

Run the file with Python after saving to confirm it executes without errors:
  python C:/DataMajor/practice/NNNNNN.LCXXXX.py

Confirm: "Saved: NNNNNN.LCXXXX.py — all tests passed"
