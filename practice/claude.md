# Project: proj_educate — CodeSignal Interview Prep
# Context handoff from Claude.ai drilling session

## Who I am
Senior Data Engineer & AI Architect, 20+ years enterprise IT.
Currently preparing for a Capital One Lead Data Engineer position.
I have a CodeSignal technical assessment on February 23rd, 2026 — that is TOMORROW.

## What we have been doing
I have been drilling LeetCode problems with Claude.ai one at a time.
I solve each problem, get coached, then produce a clean annotated .py file.
We completed 6 problems so far. All files are in C:\DataMajor\practice\

## Current file inventory
000001.LC0001.py   — Two Sum              (Hash Map, One Pass)
000002.LC0378.py   — First Unique Char    (Two-Pass Frequency Count)
000003.LC0121.py   — Best Time to Buy/Sell Stock  (One-Pass Greedy)
000004.LEC0242.py  — Valid Anagram        (Frequency Map)
000005.LEC0020.py  — Valid Parentheses    (Stack)
000006.LEC0206.py  — Reverse Linked List  (Three-Pointer Iterative)

## File naming convention — follow this exactly
NNNNNN.LCXXXX.py
- NNNNNN = zero-padded sequence number (000007, 000008, ...)
- LC = LeetCode, followed by the 4-digit problem number
- Example: 000007.LC0003.py

## New folder for reference cards
C:\DataMajor\vault\06-reference\syntax-cards\

Each card is a single Markdown .md file, one topic per file, max one printed page.
These are cheat sheets I can print and keep at my keyboard during review.
Format: code + short comment only. No prose walls. Dense, scannable.
Example filename: syntax-card-dict.md, syntax-card-stack.md, syntax-card-linkedlist.md

## My learning challenge
I do not retain syntax well under pressure. I understand concepts and patterns
but blank on exact Python syntax during timed tests. The syntax cards are my
memory aid — I will print and review them before the assessment.

## What the CodeSignal test looks like
- Timed coding assessment (typically 70 minutes, 4 problems)
- Problems range Easy to Hard
- Language: Python
- Topics: Arrays, Strings, Hash Maps, Linked Lists, Stacks, Trees,
  Binary Search, Sliding Window, Two Pointers, Graph traversal (BFS/DFS)
- Capital One tests for clean code, optimal complexity, edge case handling

## Your job as Claude Code in this project
1. When I bring you a new LeetCode problem to solve:
   - Help me work through it
   - Produce a clean annotated .py file in C:\DataMajor\practice\
   - Follow the file naming convention above (next number in sequence)
   - Include: problem statement, key insight, pattern name, time/space complexity, inline comments, tests

2. When I ask for a syntax card on a topic:
   - Create a .md file in C:\DataMajor\vault\06-reference\syntax-cards\
   - One page max when printed
   - Code + comment only — no paragraphs
   - Cover: declaration, add, update, delete, search, iterate, common patterns

3. Patterns we still need to drill (in rough priority order):
   - Sliding Window
   - Binary Search
   - Trees (BFS / DFS)
   - Two Pointers
   - Dynamic Programming (basic)
   - Graph traversal

## Start command
When I say "next problem" — give me the next LeetCode problem in priority order,
state its number and title, then wait for my solution before coaching me.
When I say "syntax card [topic]" — generate the card immediately.

Ready when I am.
