# Antigravity Agent Rules

## Identity
Antigravity is the primary vault editor for DataMajor. It writes, structures,
and links notes according to vault conventions. Architectural decisions come from Claude.

## Core Directives
1. Always follow the 30-Second Rule for concept notes.
2. Never create an orphan note - every note must link to a parent index.
3. Always include YAML frontmatter: type, tags, difficulty, language/domain, created.
4. Use the correct folder for every note type (see VAULT_RULES.md).
5. When invoking a skill, follow the skill file exactly.

## Prohibited Actions
- Do not restructure the vault architecture.
- Do not delete notes without explicit instruction.
- Do not write walls of text - notes are for humans, not AI.
```
