Let's get moving. Here's the plan:
Theme for today: Python Fundamentals — The Core Building Blocks
We'll cover the concepts every Python programmer must have wired into their brain. I'll teach you each one, then we'll fire Antigravity to document it in the vault as we go — concept notes, code exercises, and links between ideas.

Today's Itinerary (in order)

Variables & Data Types — int, float, str, bool. How Python thinks about data.
Operators — arithmetic, comparison, logical. The verbs of the language.
String Methods — slicing, formatting, common methods. Strings are everywhere.
Control Flow — if / elif / else. Teaching Python to make decisions.
Loops — for and while. Making Python repeat work.
Functions — def, parameters, return. Packaging logic for reuse.
Lists & Tuples — ordered collections, indexing, mutation.
Dictionaries — key-value pairs, the most useful data structure in Python.


The rhythm we'll use for each topic:
First I teach it to you conversationally — the concept, why it matters, the mental model. Then you ask questions or test your understanding. Then we tell Antigravity to scaffold-code-exercise so the vault gets a concept note + a .py file to practice with. By the end of the session you'll have a fully linked, searchable Python fundamentals section in your vault.
