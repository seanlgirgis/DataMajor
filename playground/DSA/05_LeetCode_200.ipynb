    "# LeetCode 200: Number of Islands\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difficulty**: Medium\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the **number of islands**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands **horizontally or vertically** (not diagonally). You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Visual Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the grid as a map. Let's look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Grid:\n",
    "[\n",
    "  [\"1\", \"1\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\"],\n",
    "  [\"1\", \"1\", \"0\", \"0\", \"0\"],\n",
    "  [\"0\", \"0\", \"1\", \"0\", \"0\"],\n",
    "  [\"0\", \"0\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\"]\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down where the islands are. Keep in mind we only look Up, Down, Left, and Right (no diagonals):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Island 1 (Top-Left):**\n",
    "The generic block of 1s in the top left corner connects horizontally and vertically.\n",
    "```\n",
    "[1, 1]\n",
    "[1, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Island 2 (Middle-Center):**\n",
    "There is a single isolated `1` in the middle. It has no orthogonal neighbors.\n",
    "```\n",
    "[1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Island 3 (Bottom-Right):**\n",
    "There is a horizontal strip of `1`s at the bottom right.\n",
    "```\n",
    "[1, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Islands:** 3\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## How to approach this\n",
    "We can treat this like a **Graph Traversal** problem!\n",
    "1. Every `'1'` (land) is a **Node**.\n",
    "2. Vertically or horizontally adjacent `'1'`s have an **Edge** between them.\n",
    "3. Finding an island is just finding a **Connected Component** in the grid.\n",
    "4. When we find an unvisited `'1'`, we found a new island. We then use **BFS** or **DFS** to visit the rest of the land connected to it, marking them as visited so we don't count them multiple times!"
