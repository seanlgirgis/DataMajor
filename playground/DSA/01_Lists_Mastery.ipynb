    "Welcome to this interactive notebook on Python lists! Today we are exploring the core mechanics of how lists function internally, specifically focusing on `insert`, `pop`, and `append`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will understand **where** these operations add or remove elements, and **how fast** they are (their Time Complexity / Big O notation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these nuances is critical for writing efficient Python code, especially when dealing with large datasets."

    "\n",
    "- **What it does:** Adds the specified element to the **very end** (the right side) of the list.\n",
    "- **Direction:** Right.\n",
    "- **Time Complexity (Big O):** **O(1)** (Constant Time)\n",
    "- **Why:** Python lists are implemented as dynamically-sized arrays under the hood. Python pre-allocates extra space in memory for lists. Because the system knows exactly where the end of the list is and typically has pre-allocated space ready, dropping a new item at the end takes a single, instant operation. It doesn't need to touch any other elements.\n",
    "- **When to use it:** This is the most optimal way to build a list. If you just need to collect items and order doesn't strictly require inserting at the front, ALWAYS use `append()`."

    "- **What it does:** Removes and returns the item at the given index. If no index is provided, it removes and returns the **last item** on the right.\n",

    "- **Time Complexity (Big O):**\n",
    "    - `pop()` (no argument / last item): **O(1)** (Constant Time). Why? Just like `append`, chopping off the last element is instant. No other elements have to move.\n",
    "    - `pop(0)` (first item) or `pop(k)` (middle item): **O(n)** (Linear Time). Why? If you remove the 1st item (index 0), every single other item in the list must physically shift one spot to the left in memory to fill the gap. If the list has 1,000,000 items, Python has to move 999,999 items. That is slow.\n",
    "- **When to use it:** `pop()` is optimal for treating a list like a \"Stack\" (Last-In, First-Out). Avoid using `pop(0)` on large lists; if you need to frequently remove from the front, use a `collections.deque` instead of a list."
