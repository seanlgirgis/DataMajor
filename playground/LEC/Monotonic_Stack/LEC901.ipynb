    "\n",
    "Here is a clean reproduction of the **LeetCode 901 – Online Stock Span** setup you can paste into your Jupyter notebook — **without including the actual solution logic in code form**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns **the span** of that stock's price for the current day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **span** of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from today and going backwards) for which the stock price was less than or equal to today's price.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were `[100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85]`, then the stock spans would be `[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the `StockSpanner` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `StockSpanner()` Initializes the object of the class.\n",
    "- `int next(int price)` Returns the span of the stock's price given that today's price is `price`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints**\n",
    "- `1 <= price <= 10^5`\n",
    "- At most `10^4` calls will be made to `next`.\n",

    "### Approach hint (English only, no code)\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that you don't need to look at every single previous day. Use a **stack** that stores pairs of `(price, span)`. For each new price, pop from the stack while the top price is less than or equal to the current price, accumulating the spans. The current span is `1 + sum of spans of all popped elements`. Push the current `(price, span)` onto the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "This achieves amortized O(1) time per `next()` call because each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck implementing it yourself!"
